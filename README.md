# SPAOverturn

This repository includes source data for the Figures and Extended Data Figures of our submitted manuscript. These data are generated by iSALE-3D and CitcomS softwares. 
The format of all data files are: longitude, latitude, value. 

Content of this repository: 
1. Modeled TiO2 and Th content of our reference model (Fig. 1): Fig1c_TiO2.txt, Fig1d_Th.txt
2. Degree-1 components of observed and modeled TiO2 content (Extended Data Fig. 1): ExtDataFig1a_ObsTiO2_degree1.txt, ExtDataFig1b_ModelTiO2_degree1.txt
3. Modeled tracer points with mantle uplift from iSALE-3D (Extended Data Fig. 2): ExtDataFig2a_mantle_uplift_I420_deg60.txt ... 
 Note: Locations of these points (currently centered at 52S, 180E) should be shifted and rotated to be consisent with the location of SPA. This can be conducted using MatLab commands distance & reckon. 
4. Modeled IBC thickness distribution from CitcomS (Extended Data Fig. 4): ExtDataFig4a_I420_deg60_v-2.txt ...

Labeling scheme for our models: For example, I420_deg60v-2 has an impactor size of 420 km, an impact angle of 60 deg, IC viscosity contrast of 10^(-2) with respect to the surrounding mantle.
